# About
My name is Artyom Perevalov. I'm 26 y.o.

Currently UI/UX at Proektmarketing+1, as a UX/UI engineer, but looking for a full-time job as Frontend developer. I have been doing Frontend for about 1 year, usally working with VanillaJS, jQuery. I have experience in maintaining projects, fixing bugs.

I've had small experience in VueJS, but for now I've decided to learn React.

At free time I'm building services, that helps me do my work faster, better. Most times using JS, but interested in learning PHP, Python.

# Repos

* [Magicard (WIP)](https://github.com/arperevalov/magicard) — my first pet-project. Its a board-game-helper. Basicaly it helps you to play some board games. You can start games, add players and count points. I have alot of interesting ideas to implement in nearest future.
* [Learning React](https://github.com/arperevalov/learning-react) — repo, where I learn React from [IT-Kamasutra](https://www.youtube.com/c/ITKAMASUTRA).
* [Lodashing](https://github.com/arperevalov/lodashing) — one wise man said once: "If you want to learn JS, you should go to [lodash documentation page](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) and rewrite every single method, based on it's description". That is what I'm doing there.
* [spotifyParser](https://github.com/arperevalov/spotifyParser) — NodeJS app that can parse your Spotify favorites playlist. It was written as a proof of concept in one evening, but I'm interested in developing it further.
* [begrab](https://github.com/arperevalov/begrab) — Chrome Extension, that helps you download pics from Behance. Written once for my art director. Should say, really helps at work, when you have to collect references for project.
