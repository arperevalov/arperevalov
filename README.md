# About
My name is Artyom Perevalov. I'm 26 y.o.

Currently working at Proektmarketing+1, as a UX/UI engineer, but looking for a full-time job as Frontend developer. I have been doing Frontend for about 1 year, usally working with VanillaJS, jQuery. I have experience in maintaining projects, fixing bugs.

I've had small experience in VueJS, but for now I've decided to learn React.

At free time I'm building services, that helps me do my work faster, better. The main language that I use is JavaScript, but I also learn Java in my spare time.

# Repos


* [PingIP](https://github.com/arperevalov/PingIP-React) — app that helps to monitor IP-devices activity. You can ping IP's and get logs from all servers and devices you have. Made for factory IT-department.
* [Lodashing](https://github.com/arperevalov/lodashing) — one wise man said once: "If you want to learn JS, you should go to [lodash documentation page](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) and rewrite every single method, based on it's description". That is what I'm doing there.
* [begrab](https://github.com/arperevalov/begrab) — Chrome Extension, that helps you download pics from Behance. Written once for my art director. Should say, really helps at work, when you have to collect references for project.
* * [Magicard (WIP)](https://github.com/arperevalov/magicard) — my first pet-project. Its a board-game-helper. Basicaly it helps you to play some board games. You can start games, add players and count points. I have alot of interesting ideas to implement in nearest future.
